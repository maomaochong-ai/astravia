# Upstream

The files in this directory are adapted from **Hallmark**, a design skill that
targets the defaults every LLM falls back to.

## What was adapted

Hallmark emits standalone HTML + CSS marketing pages. Everything here was
rewritten for `.astravia-design` frames — fixed-size TSX, Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens in
`theme.css`, fonts as installed `@fontsource` packages — and widened from landing
pages to the product types this skill covers (app screens, dashboards, slides,
posters).

| Here | From Hallmark |
| --- | --- |
| `directions.md` | `genres/*.md`, the tone step of SKILL.md |
| `color.md` | `color.md` |
| `typography.md` | `typography.md` (font catalogue narrowed to packages verified on fontsource) |
| `anti-patterns.md` | `anti-patterns.md` + the screenshot-visible gates of `slop-test.md` |
| `landing-structures.md` | `macrostructures.md` + `macrostructures/*.md`, condensed |
| `copy.md` | `copy.md`, plus Chinese-language equivalents |
| `app-density.md` | not in Hallmark — written for this skill |
| `whitespace.md` | not in Hallmark — written for this skill |

## What was deliberately left out

- The `audit` / `redesign` / `study` verbs. Style extraction already exists as
  design-resource packs in the Design sidebar.
- The three-question gate before building. This skill infers the direction and
  states it; it does not interview the user.
- CSS stamps, `.hallmark/log.json`, `tokens.css`, the preview block. The `.astravia-design`
  bundle already records the design; `theme.css` is the token file.
- Responsive breakpoint gates, motion and microinteraction recipes, hero video /
  Lottie / generated-image enrichment. Frames are fixed-size and mostly static.
- The 21 catalog themes. Named styles belong in design-resource packs the user
  picks, not in the prompt.
